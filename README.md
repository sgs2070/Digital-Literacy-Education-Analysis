# Digital-Literacy-Education-Analysis
# Analysis of Factors Affecting Digital Skill Improvement

This project aims to analyze data related to the impact of environmental factors (rural/urban) and other variables such as gender and age on the improvement of digital skills after training. The project involves examining relationships between variables using statistical analysis and linear regression algorithms. It also presents visual analysis using graphs and charts to illustrate differences in outcomes across various categories.

## Features:
- Comparison between males and females  computer knowledge, internet usage, and mobile literacy scores.
- Examination of the impact of environment type (rural/urban) on digital literacy levels.
- Development of a predictive model using linear regression to measure the impact of age on skill improvement.
- Statistical analysis using ANOVA and correlation tests to explore relationships between variables.

## How to use:
1. Download your dataset into the working environment.
2. Run the Python code using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib.
3. Review the graphical analysis and results to determine the impact of various factors on digital skill improvement.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- numpy library
- matplotlib library
- seaborn library
